/**
 * @title YearnV3Strategy
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice Yield-donating strategy that compounds rewards from a Yearn v3 vault
 * @dev Deposits assets into a Yearn v3 vault to earn yield, which is donated via
 *      BaseHealthCheck's profit minting mechanism
 *
 *      YIELD FLOW:
 *      1. Deposits assets into Yearn v3 vault
 *      2. Vault generates yield from its strategies
 *      3. On report, profit is minted as shares to donation address
 *
 *      META-VAULT CONSIDERATION:
 *      - If Yearn vault deposits into meta-vaults (e.g., Morpho → SteakHouse),
 *        maxDeposit may be inflated due to duplicate markets in supply queues
 *      - This can cause temporary deposit DoS but doesn't affect withdrawals
 *
 *      LOSS HANDLING:
 *      - Accepts 100% loss on withdrawals to prevent revert cascades
 *      - MultistrategyVault performs actual loss validation via updateDebt
 *
 * @custom:security Yearn vault convertToAssets must be manipulation-resistant
