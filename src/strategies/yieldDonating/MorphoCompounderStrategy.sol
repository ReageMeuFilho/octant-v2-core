/**
 * @title MorphoCompounderStrategy
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice Yield-donating strategy that compounds rewards from a Morpho vault
 * @dev Deposits assets into a Morpho compounder vault (e.g., Morpho Steakhouse) to earn yield
 *
 *      YIELD FLOW:
 *      1. Deposits assets into Morpho compounder vault
 *      2. Vault compounds yield automatically via Morpho markets
 *      3. On report, profit is minted as shares to donation address
 *
 *      META-VAULT INFLATION ISSUE:
 *      - When compounderVault is a meta-vault (e.g., Morpho → SteakHouse),
 *        maxDeposit chains through multiple vaults
 *      - If underlying vaults have duplicate markets in supply queues,
 *        maxDeposit may overstate actual capacity
 *      - This can cause deposits to temporarily revert but is not a critical issue
 *
 *      LOSS HANDLING:
 *      - Accepts 100% loss on withdrawals to prevent revert cascades
 *      - MultistrategyVault enforces actual loss limits via updateDebt
 *
 * @custom:security Morpho vault convertToAssets must be manipulation-resistant
