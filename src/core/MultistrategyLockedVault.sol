 * @title MultistrategyLockedVault
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice A locked vault with custody-based rage quit mechanism and two-step cooldown period changes
 *
 * @dev This vault implements a secure custody system that prevents rage quit cooldown bypass attacks
 * and provides user protection through a two-step governance process for cooldown period changes.
 *
 * ## Custody Mechanism:
 *
 * 1. **Share Locking During Rage Quit:**
 *    - Users must initiate rage quit for a specific number of shares
 *    - Those shares are placed in custody and cannot be transferred
 *    - Locked shares are tracked separately from the user's transferable balance
 *    - Transfer restrictions prevent bypassing the cooldown period
 *    - Only one active rage quit per user (no multiple concurrent rage quits)
 *
 * 2. **Custody Lifecycle:**
 *    - **Initiation**: User specifies exact number of shares to lock for rage quit
 *    - **Cooldown**: Shares remain locked and non-transferable during cooldown period
 *    - **Unlock**: After cooldown, user can withdraw/redeem up to their custodied amount
 *    - **Withdrawal**: Users can make multiple withdrawals from the same custody
 *    - **Completion**: Custody is cleared when all locked shares are withdrawn
 *
 * 3. **Transfer Restrictions:**
 *    - Users cannot transfer locked shares to other addresses
 *    - Available shares = total balance - locked shares
 *    - Prevents rage quit cooldown bypass through share transfers
 *    - Use `getTransferableShares()` to check available balance for transfers
 *
 * 4. **Withdrawal Rules:**
 *    - Users can only withdraw shares if they have active custody
 *    - Withdrawal amount cannot exceed remaining custodied shares
 *    - Multiple partial withdrawals are allowed from the same custody
 *    - New rage quit required after custody is fully withdrawn
 *    - `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` return 0 if no custody or still in cooldown
 *
 * 5. **Utility Functions:**
 *    - `getTransferableShares(user)`: Returns shares available for transfer
 *    - `getRageQuitableShares(user)`: Returns shares available for rage quit initiation
 *    - `custodyInfo(user)`: Returns custody details (locked shares, unlock time)
 *
 * ## Two-Step Cooldown Period Changes:
 *
 * 1. **Grace Period Protection:**
 *    - Governance proposes cooldown period changes with 14-day delay
 *    - Users can rage quit under current terms during grace period
 *    - Protects users from unfavorable governance decisions
 *
 * 2. **Change Process:**
 *    - **Propose**: Governance proposes new period, starts grace period
 *    - **Grace Period**: 14 days for users to exit under current terms
 *    - **Finalize**: Anyone can finalize change after grace period
 *    - **Cancel**: Governance can cancel during grace period
 *
 * 3. **User Protection:**
 *    - Users who rage quit before finalization use old cooldown period
 *    - Users who rage quit after finalization use new cooldown period
 *    - No retroactive application of cooldown changes
 *
 * ## Governance:
 *
 * - **Regen Governance**: Has control over rage quit cooldown period changes
 * - **Direct Transfer**: Governance can be transferred immediately (no 2-step process)
 * - **Access Control**: Only regen governance can propose/cancel cooldown changes
 *
 * ## Example Scenarios:
 *
 * **Scenario A - Basic Custody Flow:**
 * 1. User has 1000 shares, initiates rage quit for 500 shares
 * 2. 500 shares locked in custody, 500 shares remain transferable
 * 3. `getTransferableShares(user)` returns 500, `getRageQuitableShares(user)` returns 0
 * 4. After cooldown, user can withdraw up to 500 shares
 * 5. User withdraws 300 shares, 200 shares remain in custody
 * 6. User can later withdraw remaining 200 shares without new rage quit
 *
 * **Scenario B - Two-Step Cooldown Change:**
 * 1. Current cooldown: 7 days, governance proposes 14 days
 * 2. Grace period: Users have 14 days to rage quit under 7-day terms
 * 3. User A rage quits during grace period → uses 7-day cooldown
 * 4. Change finalized after grace period
 * 5. User B rage quits after finalization → uses 14-day cooldown
 *
 * **Scenario C - Utility Function Usage:**
 * 1. User has 1000 shares, no active rage quit
 * 2. `getTransferableShares(user)` returns 1000
 * 3. `getRageQuitableShares(user)` returns 1000
 * 4. User initiates rage quit for 400 shares
 * 5. `getTransferableShares(user)` returns 600
 * 6. `getRageQuitableShares(user)` returns 0 (already has active rage quit)
