/**
 * @title Tokenized Strategy (Octant V2 Fork)
 * @author yearn.finance; forked and modified by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice
 *  This TokenizedStrategy is a fork of Yearn's TokenizedStrategy that has been
 *  modified by Octant to support donation functionality and other security enhancements.
 *
 *  The original contract can be used by anyone wishing to easily build
 *  and deploy their own custom ERC4626 compliant single strategy Vault.
 *
 *  The TokenizedStrategy contract is meant to be used as the proxy
 *  implementation contract that will handle all logic, storage and
 *  management for a custom strategy that inherits the `BaseStrategy`.
 *  Any function calls to the strategy that are not defined within that
 *  strategy will be forwarded through a delegateCall to this contract.
 *
 *  A strategist only needs to override a few simple functions that are
 *  focused entirely on the strategy specific needs to easily and cheaply
 *  deploy their own permissionless 4626 compliant vault.
 *
 *  @dev Changes from Yearn V3:
 *  - Added dragonRouter to the StrategyData struct to enable yield distribution
 *  - Added getter and setter for dragonRouter
 *  - Added validation checks for all critical addresses (management, keeper, emergencyAdmin, dragonRouter)
 *  - Enhanced initialize function to include emergencyAdmin and dragonRouter parameters
 *  - Standardized error messages for zero-address checks
 *  - Removed the yield/profit unlocking mechanism (profits are immediately realized)
 *  - Made the report() function virtual to enable specialized implementations
 *  - Made this contract abstract as a base for specialized strategy implementations
 *
 *  Two specialized implementations are provided:
 *  - YieldDonatingTokenizedStrategy: Mints profits as new shares and sends them to a specified dragon router
 *  - YieldSkimmingTokenizedStrategy: Skims the appreciation of asset and dilutes the original shares by minting new ones to the dragon router
 *
 *  Trust Minimization (design goals):
 *  - No protocol performance/management fees at the strategy level; yield flows directly to the configured donation destination
 *  - Dragon router changes are subject to a mandatory cooldown (see setDragonRouter/finalizeDragonRouterChange)
 *  - Clear role separation: management, keeper, emergencyAdmin; keepers focus on report/tend cadence
 *
 *  Security Model (trusted roles and expectations):
 *  - Management: updates roles, initiates dragon router changes, may shutdown in emergencies
 *  - Keeper: calls report/tend at appropriate intervals; use MEV-protected mempools when possible
 *  - Emergency Admin: can shutdown and perform emergency withdrawals
 *
 *  Threat Model Boundaries (non-exhaustive):
 *  - In scope: precision/rounding issues, price-per-share manipulation via airdrops (mitigated by tracked totalAssets),
 *    reentrancy (guarded), misuse of roles
 *  - Out of scope: malicious management/keeper/emergency admin; complete compromise of external yield sources
 *
 *  Functional Requirements mapping (high-level):
 *  - FR-1 Initialization: initialize() parameters include asset, name and roles, plus donation routing settings
 *  - FR-2 Asset management: BaseStrategy overrides (_deployFunds/_freeFunds/_harvestAndReport) power the yield logic
 *  - FR-3 Roles: requireManagement/requireKeeperOrManagement/requireEmergencyAuthorized helpers enforce permissions
 *  - FR-4 Donation management: dragon router cooldown and two-step change via setDragonRouter/finalize/cancel
 *  - FR-5 Emergency: shutdownStrategy/emergencyWithdraw hooks in specialized implementations
 *  - FR-6 ERC-4626: full ERC-4626 surface for deposits/withdrawals and previews is implemented
 *
 *  WARNING: When creating custom strategies, DO NOT declare state variables outside
 *  the StrategyData struct. Doing so risks storage collisions if the implementation
 *  contract changes. Either extend the StrategyData struct or use a custom storage slot.
