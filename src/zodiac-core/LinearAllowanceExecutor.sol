/// @notice Abstract base contract for executing linear allowance transfers from Gnosis Safe modules
/// @dev This contract provides the core functionality for interacting with LinearAllowanceSingletonForGnosisSafe
/// while leaving withdrawal mechanisms to be implemented by derived contracts. The contract can receive
/// both ETH and ERC20 tokens from allowance transfers, but the specific withdrawal logic must be defined
/// by inheriting contracts to ensure proper access control and business logic implementation.
///
/// Assumptions and security model:
/// - This executor contract instance is configured as the delegate in the LinearAllowance module.
/// - A module address set may be set via `assignModuleAddressSet`; `_validateModule` enforces it on calls.
/// - The moduleAccessMode determines how the moduleAddressSet is used:
///   - NONE: any module is allowed (no validation)
///   - ALLOWSET: only modules in moduleAddressSet are allowed
///   - BLOCKSET: any module EXCEPT those in moduleAddressSet are allowed
